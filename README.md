# Train-Time

## Project Description

This project uses trains to give practice using firebase (server-side hosting) and moment.js to calculate time automatically and populate them to a table. Aside from the column headers, all of the rows in the table are completely built using script functions. The time is calculated using a variety of momnet js functions. This project is not my most visually creative one, however, I wanted to focus on what was being done and simplicity of the information being provided.
